      # Note: For client-side SPA (browser) to access backend, 
      # if generic usage, localhost:3000 works if user maps backend port to host.
      # If SSR or server-to-server, use http://backend:3000.
      # Since this is SPA, browser runs it. Browser sees 'localhost:3000' as host machine if port mapped.
